Shell Scripting

1. Linux does not require file extensions.
2. Code is developed in Windows / MacOS. These OSs does require file extension, Else they will be able to help. Addition to this, Editor also would be needing this extension because to understand / suggest you what code you are writing.
3. Coming to shell, We provide extension usually as .sh to tell that is a shell script. Or .bash to exclusively tell that is bash shell script ( Not needed)
